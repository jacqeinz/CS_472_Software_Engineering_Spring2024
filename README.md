Hotel Website/Management System
Team ABCFG
This project serves as a comprehensive tool for hotels to efficiently manage reservations and streamline guest interactions. By leveraging this system, hotels can optimize their booking processes, enhance guest satisfaction, and improve overall operational efficiency. Guests benefit from a seamless experience, enabling them to make reservations conveniently, access relevant information about their stay, and interact with hotel services seamlessly. With features tailored to both hotel staff and guests, this application aims to modernize and elevate the hospitality experience for all stakeholders involved.
Description
All the source files for this application are in the “src” directory, under the source directory there are two more directories, “main” and “test/java”. Starting with the main directory you will see a folder with the repository name. In that folder there are 4 key directories. 
Controllers, entities, repositories, and service. Controllers handle the data between the view and model, service handles the model side of things talking to the repositories, and the entities are the individual entities used for this application. Under the “java/test” directory is where all of our unit testing is stored for each service file since that is where the functionality goes. The “pom.xml” file is where all of our dependencies are stored that we used for this application.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================================================


1. Unpack the IntelliJ IDEA distribution archive that you downloaded where you wish to install the program. We will refer to this location as your {installation home}.


2. To start the application, open a console, cd into "{installation home}/bin" and type:


        ./idea.sh


   This will initialize various configuration files in the configuration directory:
   ~/.config/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2024.1.


3. [OPTIONAL] Add "{installation home}/bin" to your PATH environment variable so that you can start IntelliJ IDEA from any directory.


4. [OPTIONAL] To adjust the value of the JVM heap size, create a file idea.vmoptions (or idea64.vmoptions if using a 64-bit JDK) in the configuration directory and set the -Xms and -Xmx parameters. To see how to do this, you can reference the vmoptions file under "{installation home}/bin" as a model, but do not modify it, add your options to the new file.


   [OPTIONAL] Change the location of the "config" and "system" directories
